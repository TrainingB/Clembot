# Clembot
A Discord helper bot for Pokemon Go communities.

Clembot is a Discord bot written in Python 3.5 using version 0.16.8 of the discord.py library.

## Clembot 2.0 is here!

Clembot is now able to handle being on multiple servers of any size in any part of the world and can be invited to your server without having to install Python or run anything on a local machine yourself. The configuration process is now handled completely on Discord via DM with the server owner. First, a list of current features:

1. User-driven (not automated) wild spawn and raid reporting.
2. Role management for each Pokemon species (Discord limits a server to 250 roles, however) that allows each user to opt-in only for the Pokemon they want. These roles are mentioned when spawns or raids are reported.
3. Raid reporting: Report either !raidegg, !raid or !exraid on the server to have Clembot create channels to organise in. Certain commands can be used within raid channels, such as updating your stauts with !interested, !coming and !here. Users can easily determine the status of involved members with the !list command. Clembot also queries Google Maps to get a guess of the raid location (no access to the game means no list of gyms), or you can paste a maps link in the channel after creation to update it to exact coordinates.
4. Optional team management and new member welcome functions.

## Directions for inviting a remotely hosted Clembot to your server:
Note: You must have manage_server permissions to invite.
1. Use [THIS LINK](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=346759953006198784&scope=bot&permissions=268822608) to invite Clembot.   
2. Select your server.
3. In your server, type !configure.
4. Clembot will DM you to setup your server. Be sure to read the prompts properly.
5. That's it! Enjoy!


You can join the Clembot server here for updates, setup help, feature requests, or just to test out the bot before you add it. https://discord.gg/hhVjAN8

If you want to tinker with Clembot yourself, you can still download this repo, make whatever changes you want (or keep everything if you want) and run Clembot locally. The configure process is the same except you'll have to use your own bot token.

## Directions for installing and running the bot on your server:


1. Install Python 3.5.
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/

2. Install the packages needed to run Clembot:

Linux:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py pillow requests pytesseract hastebin.py
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng
```

Windows:
```bash
py -m pip install -U discord.py pillow requests pytesseract hastebin.py
```
Tesseract-OCR has to be installed with a standard binary installer on Windows.
Get the installer [HERE](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Downloads)

3. Download the files in this repository. The source code is in Clembot.py and bot config is in config.json.

4. Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me#top and create a new app.

5. Name it and upload the avatar of your choice.

6. Create a bot user for your app and reveal the bot token to copy it.

7. Open config.json in a text editor (a good one to use is Notepad++) and paste the bot token into the value for "bot_token", replacing the "yourtoken" string.

8. Replace the "master" value in config.json with your full discord username with the 4 digits after the hash.

9. Run Clembot.py from the command prompt or terminal window. If successful, it should show "Clembot! That's right!".

10. Go back to your Discord application page and copy the Client ID.

11. Go to the following link, replacing <CLIENT_ID> with the Client ID you copied.
`https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&scope=bot&permissions=268822608`

12. Select the server you want to add Clembot to and complete the prompts. If you get to an empty screen and didn't get to see the Google new reCaptcha tickbox, disable your adblocker.

9. The bot should now have sent you DM in Discord. Add the team roles: mystic, instinct and valor. Ensure they're below the bot role in the server role hierarchy.

10. Simply type !configure in your server to start the configuration process.

## General notes on Clembot:

Clembot relies completely on users for reports. Clembot was designed as an alternative to Discord bots that use scanners and other illegitimate sources of information about Pokemon Go. As a result, Clembot works only as well as the users who use it. As there are 10+ ways of interacting with Clembot, there can be a bit of a rough learning period, but it quickly becomes worth it.

## Known issues:

Compatibility with Python 3.6 on Mac OS X requires running "Install Certificates.command" in the Python 3.6 folder. Incompatible with discord.py 1.0
